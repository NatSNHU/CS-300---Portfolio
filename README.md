What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I went over the different data structures to better understand their pros and cons. I've designed and prototyped a program to organise course information for an educational company.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
After assesing the options between Vector, Hashtable, and binary search table I found that BST had a lower computational complexity. Understanding the trade-offs between the different data types 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
