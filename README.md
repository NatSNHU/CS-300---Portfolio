What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I went over the different data structures to better understand their pros and cons. I've designed and prototyped a program to organise course information for an educational company.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
After assesing the options between Vector, Hashtable, and binary search table I found that BST had a lower computational complexity. Understanding the trade-offs between the different data types helps design more effecient programs.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Having prior programming experience, the only roadblock I came across was new material and algorythms. It did take a bit of thinking outside of the box, but i did arrive at a quaility final product in the end.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Now that Im starting to approach the limits of what I know, I've learned that doing more research on material helps make projects easiers and more managable.
